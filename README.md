# Untitled-Game

My Capstone project was a fun project to build, and it was an idea I had been holding onto for a little while. 
This project is essentially a proof-of-concept of that idea. The gameplay loop involved having precise real-time melee combat with the freedom to swing in any 
of the cardinal directions using your mouse. Waves of zombies would continously spawn faster and faster as you traveled through a procedurally generated castle searching
for new weapons.
